        So this is usuing Zettlr seems easy enough a breath of fresh air compared to Obsidian So  why did they make it so hard to configure. No wonder they have to advertise it on youtube. I fell for the videos telling us how great it is. It must be good for those who can figure it out. But sadly I am not one of them this means is also much easier than the dreaded Sobsidian. ha fuck obbsidian spent 2 weeks of my life faffing around with it No more .Still got it installed on here but just so I can have a play around see if I can get anything working on it. My sense of being a bit of a hacker doesn't want to give up just yet. A m going to have a play around with it see it I can get it working properly.At the moment I hav qownNotes installed also it also seems to be a brilliand not taking app much friendlier than Sobsidian. Jus tkills me I can't get it to work properlyReminds me of Lotus123 from years ago that was keyboard driven and could baffle anyone. Had to do a weeks course just to learn how it works. Seems Sobsidian is in the same vein you have to do a course to learn how it works. ffs. See lots of people using it but noboy really gives ablow by blow account of how to configure it, All those telling how it works must be shills for the app..Thats my take on it.
        Don't even talk to me about git. GITHUB Now that is even a bigger rabbit hole to crawl down. At least with that it doesn't pretend to be easy. Like the shills for Obsidian pretend its easy when it is a brain surgeons night mare.
        Feel much better afer a moan to my self.
