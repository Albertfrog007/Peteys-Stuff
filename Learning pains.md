So after 3 installs and uninstallations I have a clearer idea of the structure of this program,
Vault      top tier which I call Peteys Stuff
Captains Log    folder.
Daily not which is inside    folder   Captains Log.
All the youtube videos are over complicated. 
Too much explanation my mind goes blank listening to all the fluff. 
On the other hand nobody explains step by step method. 
Just al ot of talking clicking and rushing through various proceedures. 
Too quick for the mind to absorb. 
Elizabeth Butler has a website that seems like a breath of fresh air. Just instructions to startup which was exactly what i needed. 
Got further down the rabbit hole of Obsidian. I just want to use it for storing ideas and thoughts. But the last 2 weeks has been trying to get a clearer idea of how all this works.
I nearly gave up and was going to stick with my colornote on my phone but that is only good for short notes.
