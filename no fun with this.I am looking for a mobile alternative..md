So this is another page maybe I have half a clue now.
2023.10.01 New note
Worked in garden sprayed wormkiller on beams.Hope it works.Blood wood worm nightmare.
Half the battle was looking for old clothes to wear.Wore overalls I. The end.Still pissed couldn't find my old shorts .Probably turn up in the end.
Got a love. Hate relationship with this obsidian love the gadgets but figuring out how it all works is a lifetime job I think.Found some othe apps that work straight out of the box.Got about 4 note taking apps on the go now.All least not short of note taking hah..
Was really annoyed as I couldn't get things to work.Just shit ton to learn.But I am in no rush.Youtube videos of all the apps most of it is on the computer.I was working from my mobile phone so half the things need to be setup differently from the desktop version.Haven' t seen any mobile version. Instructions yet.Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.Well I havent looked yet.Everytime I flash up the laptop I suddenly get tired and can't be arsed.So much easier to sit with the phone rather than the laptop.I need a very large screened phone or a very small laptop.heh.
