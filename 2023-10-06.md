## Journal Entries
- So it only took about two weeks to get notes working. Limitless possibilities, but have I fallen for the hype of the usefulness. Zettlr is far easier but I am a sucke rfor a challenge. Also the colur scheme appeals to my small ego. 
- Qown Notes is very good also. So I think I have fallen for the hype of how good Obsidian is. I like the graph view looks really cool. Bottom line it doesn't help produce more thoughts just prevents me from being more productive in journaling. I think I am spoilt for choice.
