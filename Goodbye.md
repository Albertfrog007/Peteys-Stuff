I just deleted Obsidian from my phone. Just  couldn't get on with it. See if the desktop is any better. Works as vanilla no plugins. Setting up plugins is a trial.
Why they jus t don't make it more intuitive. I predict all the advertising on youtube will suck people in like me. Only later after finding out you need to be a rocket scientist to get things working people will look for simpler solutions.  Sad but I like the idea just implementation is really unfriendly. Most normal people haven't got time to mess arounnd trying to get things configured.
Click install and open up then it should work. Not tons of  filling empty prompt boxes. Absolutely rubbish.
I am going to look for another desktop solution.
See how long I keep this before using another means.

Then  I came back the challenge wouldn't go away, even though I am fedup how difficult it is to navigate....
